Porting Five Nights at F***boy's to GML!  
By porting FNaFB to GML, it will be able to run on other platforms, e.g. Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Better support for Windows 7+, Mac OSX, Linux, HTML 5 and even more! Plus, the rpgmaker runtime won't be required to play.
The uptimate aim is to make the game better than the original, with HD textures, shaders and additional gameplay mechanics, as well as making the game run more smoothely on mobile.

Anyone experienced in writing GML and/or testing game logic is welcome. We need to study stuff like how high the spawn rate for enemies are and so on...

Five Nights at F***boy's was originally made by Sable Lynn & Joshua Shaw. You can view the current game at http://gamejolt.com/games/five-nights-at-f-boy-s-final-mix/53422
